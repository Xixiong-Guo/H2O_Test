# H2O_Test

This is a notebook about my first dive into [H2O Flow platform](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/flow.html#about). 
Housing pricing data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) is imported to predict the house price using GBM(Gradient boosting method).

As it is my first dive into H2O flow, I focus on the UI more than data manipulation, such as feature engineering, data preprocessing, etc..
I build the GBM model with the original dataset.

What I learnt:
1) H2O flow can be opened within localhost. The UI is very simple, but straightforward.
2) Train and test the model with a few clicks, which is convenient. Also, I believe it is the trend of data science in the future.
3) The model training process is very efficient with decent accuracy.


Future work:
Next, I will get into autoML using H2O.
